# SpeedSplit

SpeedSplit is an OpenPlanet plugin for Trackmania that provides split time comparisons similar to LiveSplit. Each checkpoint in a Trackmania map becomes a split, and each run on that map can be compared to the player's Personal Best (PB) or even against the World Record (WR).

## Features

- Split Times: View your split times for each checkpoint
- Comparison: Compare your current run with your Personal Best (PB) or the World Record (WR)
